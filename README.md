# AdWords-Scripts-Snippets

### email-sheet-contents.js
Contains two snippets, both for sending emails
1) Send the contents of a spreadsheet (the output sheet)
2) Send a message, along with the contents of the settings

On all scripts:
1) Include an email
2) Email the results (top 30 or so) if it's helpful (usually is)
3) Also add a copy of the sheet settings (a lot of client issues are due to the wrong settings, a reminder helps here plus it's a nice touch)
